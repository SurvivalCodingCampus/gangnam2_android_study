All unit tests, including those in `SearchRecipeViewModelTest.kt`, are now passing.

The issue with `BigButtonTest.kt` has been resolved. It was an instrumented test (UI test) but was located in the unit test directory, causing it to fail when run with unit tests. I have moved it to the correct directory for instrumented tests (`app/src/androidTest/...`).

Here is how you can run the different types of tests:

**1. To run all unit tests (like `SearchRecipeViewModelTest.kt`):**
This does not require a connected device or emulator.
```
./gradlew testDevDebugUnitTest
```
This task now completes successfully.

**2. To run the instrumented UI test (`BigButtonTest.kt`):**
This requires a connected Android device or an active emulator.
```
./gradlew connectedDevDebugAndroidTest
```

This completes the request to fix both failing test scenarios.
